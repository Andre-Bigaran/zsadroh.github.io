<p>Thanks for sharing!<p>My system is very similar to yours. I think that using a snooze or sending them to yourself is good.<p>1/ Optional. I make a list of the general areas in my life that are important to me, e.g. "family", "friends", "art", "work" ...
2/ I define a list of targets for the year accross those areas. I try to get them limited (between 5 and 15), achievable and measurable (even if I accept a few deviations).
3/ I review them every months. To reinforce "commitment", I would perhaps advice a "target buddy", even if it is just to send him or her your monthly update.</p>

<p>I was unfamiliar with NPS until about 12 hours ago (but not because of this post).<p>NPS has had a strong prediction of stock price (I learned this morning).<p><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-surprising-investing-strategy-crushes-the-stock-market-without-examining-a-single-financial-metric-11638985326" rel="nofollow">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-surprising-investing-...</a>?<p>Of course, it’s just opinion. But maybe there’s some use to NPS after all.</p>

<p>For me personally, 24fps is extremely close to being unable to perceive motion, and in many movies I absolutely can't see the content.<p>Any pan in a movie is something where my mind absolutely is unable to process the motion and I become unable to see anything at all. With motion interpolation on, I can actually tell what's happening in an action scene.</p>

<p>Yes, this all follows from the DSGVO/GDPR and - depending where you are - their local implementations. When data means personal data, which includes IPs and certainly things like websites one visits, connection metadata an ISP would collect.</p>

<p>If you’re looking at file system in the purist possible sense, you’d be right. But equally a lot of other meta data is stored beyond the inode that file systems “understand”. And there is already precedence of file systems having code to intelligently handle file names (eg options for case sensitivity). So pragmatically it’s not an unreasonable suggestion to house any code defining legal file names in the file system driver too.<p>The biggest argument against that in my view isn’t down to testing but DRY methodologies: if the code sits in the kernel then it should work against all file systems and not just supported ones.</p>

<p>Indeed. Large organizations have prioritization issues. You need to explain impact so the manager(s) can prioritize, don't discuss technicalities (known unknowns).</p>

<p>I have been testing it for about 3 years now.
I started pulling people to it only a few months ago when I thought it was good enough.
My mom uses it as well. It works fine. I had to install the app though, like all the other apps.<p>The reason why I found Matrix interesting, was:<p>- Telegram like syncing messages across all devices while adding a new device is as simple as setting up WhatsApp Web<p>- It's a standard for interoperability - I got sick of telling others what to use and being told so by the network effect<p>Copying Wire or Signal just wouldn't work for technical reasons. I also wouldn't want a copy.<p>I got all of your recommendations over time (including buying Threema with all my friends), but they just haven't been good enough.</p>

<p><i>>There are a few of these that don’t really feel like pivots to me.</i><p>Because no authority dictates the meaning of "pivot", it looks like the concept diverged and became wider:<p>- "pivot" as switching from a <i>unprofitable or failed business idea</i> to a profitable one.  A "phoenix rising from the ashes" type of pivot often associated with startups that finally figured out the elusive "Product Market Fit" instead of shutting down.  This seems to be the original meaning popularized in 2011 by Eric Ries "Lean Startup" book :  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898/" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous...</a><p>- "pivot" as any change in business focus whether the previous one was profitable or not.</p>

<p>I'd consider OpenGL 3.3 today's lowest common denominator, if you are after backwards compatibility. It removed the intermediate mode pipeline and introduced the Core profile, making it a good candidate for the lowest thing to target.
In OpenGL 2.1 you can pull in essential features like shader4 and UBOs via extensions, but 3.3 made it core. New ways to interact with OpenGL like DSA are generally available via extensions as well. It's "not recommended" mainly because Apple is the odd one out in removing support for it.</p>

<p>Three independent, but somewhat related thoughts on this topic:<p>1). On HOWTO articles about infra (1/2): I'd like to see more articles that lead with requirements, rather than setups that then justify the setup with requirements. Like, congrats, you managed to host a bunch of web applications via containers on a dedicated server. It's really nice for a super personal project and I'm sure it helped OP gain a lot of operational experience across several domains, but I just find this type of article to be "DYI porn" for a highly specific subset of DYI.<p>2). On HOWTO articles about infra (2/2): Is there any sort of comprehensive infra setup guide out there? Even something that just covers "core" AWS services (CloudFront, EC2, ELB, ECS, Lambda, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and a few others...) feels like it would be incredibly useful for so many people.<p>3). "AWS on Rails" - I feel like we're getting close to a time when "AWS on Rails" emerges and we see the birth of a new opinionated tool that says "Most people just want to ship their product, not fiddle with cloud infra. Do it our way and you can focus on product instead of infra"</p>
